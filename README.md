## Summary

We investigate a data set containing 1,157 baseball players including their handedness (right or left handed), height, weight, batting average, and home runs. I am concerned about the relationship between handedness with height, weight, bitting average and home runs, so I make boxplot of these variables. You can choose button from left to see different box plots.

## Design

I use box plot to see relationship of different handedness with other variables, I also add 4 buttons so that readers can investigate relationship between handedness and 4 variables (`height`, `weight`, `batting average` and `home runs`) separately.
