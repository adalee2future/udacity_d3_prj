## Summary

We investigate a data set containing 1,157 baseball players including their handedness (right or left handed), height, weight, batting average, and home runs. From 4 plots we see that both handed baseball players have less height and weight on average, in other words, players with higher height and weight tend to prefer use only one hand. For performance, left-handed baseball players stand out in both batting averag and home runs.

## Design

Since I am concerned about the relationship between handedness with height, weight, bitting average and home runs separately, so I make boxplot of these variables. Using boxplot help me see average values group by handedness and we can also see the value distribution of each handedness group. To make you more focused and does not distract by other plots, I only show one plot at one time, you can switch plots by click buttons.

## Feedback

### Person 1:
To me, it seems the most interesting finding is that left handed players seem to have higher averages and higher home run values. I'm not sure that the height and weight charts tell me anything specific. The difference in the both handed players vs the other handed players could just be due to the both handed players having a small sample size.

### Person 2:
What do I notice? Left handed batters appear to, typically, have better stats for both batting average and HR. Which is interesting. Switch hitters are both shorter and lighter, on average, than either left of right handed players.

Questions, as a visual tool, box plots are a good way to summarize information. In the case of HR, for example, you probably should describe the output a little (as the 'tails' of the box plots are different for right and left handed batters, what does this mean). Instead of having the same description for each plot, I think that you should write a sentence or two describing or interpreting the graphs.

Over all it is an interesting approach, and easy to interpret.

p.s. when you click on each of the buttons, you should change their colors (as a guide to the viewer of which section they are at).

## Person 3:
Good
