    			<h2>Summary</h2>
    			<p>We investigate a data set containing 1,157 baseball players including their handedness (right or left handed), height, weight, batting average, and home runs. From 4 plots we see that both handed baseball players have less height and weight on average, in other words, players with higher height and weight tend to prefer use only one hand. For performance, left-handed baseball players stand out in both batting averag and home runs.</p>

    			<h2>Design</h2>
    			<p>Since I am concerned about the relationship between handedness with height, weight, bitting average and home runs separately, so I make boxplot of these variables. Using boxplot help me see average values group by handedness and we can also see the value distributions of each handedness group. To make you more focused and does not distract by other plots, I only show one plot at one time, you can switch plots by click buttons.</p>
